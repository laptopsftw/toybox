somtimes,another project gets too impossible,that you just had quit

these are the math modules

try to remove the "math" module from python,it's just modules that can perform mathematical operations(some...)

it all started when someone needs to checked his paper,then,it was talking about remainders...and it's stuck

contents:

math2 -  originally the "kumon checker",now it was developed to replace "math".i just quit,no updating.
math3 -  inspired from a presentation on pycon ph 2015,i made (my) most recursive way to do arithmetic.as of now,it only works on whole numbers.
jandro - from a suggestion of jandro r. lim , it's planned to find zeroes of a binomial,then for any n-th nomial equation...then galois,then blah...then eigenvalues...
pseudoprimes and prime-as a result of a month crazed about fermat,a prime finder,then pseudoprime finder.
collatz-collatz conjecture...it just generate a number's "paths",well,given there is a starter point(at variable "a"),then it solves everything up to positive infinity
