i sometimes mezmerize myself in prime numbers...
then i found the algorithm of pierre de fermat
then it has holes
then i made collecting


this is (originally) a pseudoprime generator and (it became,with some adjustments) a prime generator
just generates a list of numbers...first,via pierre's algorithm,and sift it via erastosthenes

good.

requires blank files "x" and "y"
