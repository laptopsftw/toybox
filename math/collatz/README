i hoped for more.and it came

it all started a busy schoolday night.

then i read discrete math

then collatz conjecture

this python file gives a number,then find its paths if it reaches to 1,then gives another number....till positive infinity,or till it halts(which,if the paths are "loopy",who knows?not me,but you...yes...well,if it doesnt halt,it's undecidable,thanks turing)
but anyways,even unoptimized,i tried computing starting points of 10^500...how nice
everyone proved for <10^57 , but i tried bigger numbers,still good,still good

requires a blank file named "wd"
