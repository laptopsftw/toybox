um...please dont run anything from these files...it will infect thy pc
seriously

here's the "valmasci" virus that's been circulating since batch nexus...or maybe two years back

but anyways,the effects were...minimal,at least...
it's a nuisance,hiding files in a folder,named "Alt+255"(type it,it's a utf-8 , i think).
then a shortcut is created,directly to the program
then it infects,then it infects via usb's(at least)

it's easy to delete,via "attrib -r -a -s -h -i /s /d /l drivename:\\*.* " command.works on usb.but on computers?i dont know
here,at my safekeeping,we will unlock...nothing!
anyways,decompile the code,and find some dirt in there
goodluck,gentlement!

p.s. i tried to oepn it using ubuntu's archive manager,no to avail...but it opens most programs...i dont know
p.p.s i know there's a lot of good minds out there...please let me know if you know what this is...
